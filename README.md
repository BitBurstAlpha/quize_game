# Quiz Game (Python OOP)

A simple console-based quiz game built using Python’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  

The game loads **12 questions** from a predefined `question_bank` and presents them one by one to the player.  
For each question, the user inputs **"True"** or **"False"**.  
If the answer is correct, the player’s score is automatically increased.  

The game continues until all questions are answered, and the final score is displayed at the end.
